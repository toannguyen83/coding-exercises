# Coding Exercises

These are coding problems that I've encountered and failed to solve, and then use my spare time to analyze and come up with a solution. It has commented notes to help with the train of thoughts on guilding to the solution. Some tips that I learned when dealing with coding exercises:

- If there is an example input, confirm the expectation output if there isn't one.
- If the example input has many data, you can try come up with smaller input example and expected outcome.
- Use rubber duck technique, explaining how would you solve the issue first before writing the code. If it's a coding assessment with someone, communication with the opposite person is the key.
- I learned that when working under a timer, it has different pressure versus when I'm in a relaxed time slot. So it just need some practicing to keep track of time.
- Get plenty of rest before attempting to solve.
- You might not able to come up with an optimized solution right away, perhaps start with a brute force solution first.

Once you found a solution, there are other things that can improve:

- solution efficiency (big O)
- compare multiple solutions
- unit tests on corner / edge cases
- how well you can see the bugged code before running the code

Overall don't get frustrated when hitting road blocks. The goal even though is to find solution to the problem, but I think the more important is how well I understand the problem, and communicate to present the solution. This is what I'm currently lacking and why I create this repo for self training!

## Run Python Test Files

- Install pytest

```
py -m pip install pytest
```

- Run All Tests

```
py -m pytest
```

The included vscode config should also help running unit tests inside the file.
